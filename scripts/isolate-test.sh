## @file
## @brief Isolates the test from the rest of the environment.  The goal is to
##        make the test more reliable, and to avoid interrupting other processes
##        that might be running on the host.  Passes all args through and passes
##        the return code back.
##
## $1 Full path to dbus-session.sh
## $2 Path to test executable
## $3 Path to file to test
