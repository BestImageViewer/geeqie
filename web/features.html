        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Basic editing in the form of lossless 90/180-degree rotation and flipping is supported; external programs such as GIMP, Inkscape, and custom scripts using ImageMagick can be linked to allow further processing.</p>

          <p>Advanced searching is available using criteria such as filename, file size, age, image dimensions, similarity to a specified image, or by keywords or comments. If images have GPS coordinates embedded, you may also search for images within a radius of a geographical point.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Geeqie supports applying the colour profile embedded in an image along with the system monitor profile (or a user-specified monitor profile).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Geeqie sessions can be remotely controlled from external software, so it can be used as an image-viewer component of a bigger application.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Geeqie includes a 'find duplicates' tool which can compare images using a variety of criteria (filename, file size, visual similarity, dimensions, image content), either within a single folder or between two folders. Finding duplicates ignoring the rotation of images is also supported.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Images may be given a rating value (also known as a "star rating").</p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Maps from
            <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
            may be displayed in a side panel. If an image has GPS coordinates embedded, its position will be displayed on the map - if Image Direction is encoded, that will be displayed also. If an image does not have embedded GPS coordinates, it may be dragged-and-dropped onto the map to encode its position.
