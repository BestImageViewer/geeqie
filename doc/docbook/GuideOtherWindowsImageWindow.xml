  <para>An image window is a window that displays only the image, without menus or sidebars.</para>
  <para>An image window can always be opened from the context menu of all images and files. Keyboard shortcuts exist for most windows that display images or files, however the shortcut can vary dependent on the type of window containing them.</para>
  <para>
    The image pane contained in an image window behaves and operates similar to the
    <link linkend="GuideMainWindowImagePane" endterm="titleGuideMainWindowImagePane" />
    of a Main Window, including the
    <link linkend="InformationandhistogramOverlay" endterm="titleInformationandhistogramOverlay" />
    . The keyboard shortcuts are the same, and the context menu is the same except
    <emphasis>Hide file list</emphasis>
    is replaced by
    <emphasis>Close window</emphasis>
    . The
    <link linkend="GuideImagePresentationSlideshow">slide show</link>
    and
    <link linkend="GuideImagePresentationFullscreen">full screen</link>
    functions are also available.

    <para>
      When the image window is initiated from an image selection or from a collection window, the displayed image can be changed forward or backward in the list with the respective
      <keycap>PageDown</keycap>
      and
      <keycap>PageUp</keycap>
      keys. In addition, all navigation methods for the mouse and keyboard are similar to that of the
      <link linkend="GuideMainWindowImagePane" endterm="titleGuideMainWindowImagePane" />
      of a Main Window.

      Images can be dragged and dropped onto an image window, but the process is somewhat different to that of an
      <link linkend="GuideMainWindowImagePane" endterm="titleGuideMainWindowImagePane" />
      . If multiple images, a folder or an image from a collection window is dropped onto the image window, you can cycle through all these images using the navigation keys.
    </para>
    <para>The dropped item can be one or more files, folders, or an image from a collection window:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <guilabel>One or more files</guilabel>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The image window will display the first image; the list of dropped images can be navigated similar to a main window's image pane.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <guilabel>One or more folders</guilabel>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>When the dropped list of items includes a folder, a menu will appear allowing to skip the folders, add their contents, or add their contents recursively. After choosing from the menu the requested files will be added to the image window.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <guilabel>Image from a collection</guilabel>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The image window will change to display the image and become linked to the collection containing the image. Images in the collection can then be navigated and viewed from the image window.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>Changing the image window by dropping a new item onto it will cause the previous list of images or linked collection to be discarded.</para>

      To update the image display in the event that the source file has changed, press
