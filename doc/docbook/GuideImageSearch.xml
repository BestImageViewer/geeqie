  <para>Geeqie provides comprehensive set of search methods, including not only the standard functions such as file date or size, but also image similarity.</para>
  <para>There is a duplicate file finder, which uses search parameters such as image dimensions or checksum. Two sets of image files may be compared.</para>
  <para>Geeqie also has a set of temporary "marks" or "tags" which may be allocated to any image as an aide to file organising.</para>

    <para>
      Searching large numbers of files for similarity can take significant cpu time. Part of this is the time to compute the similarity matrix for each file.
      <para />
      If the
      <link linkend="PreferencesThumbnails">Cache Thumbnails</link>
      option is selected in Preferences/General, the similarity matrix, checksum, image size and Exif Date may also be cached. This will reduce the time needed for future searches.
      <note>
        If you frequently search on similarity and your images are in a tree arrangement under a single point, the
        <link linkend="CreateSimFiles">Create file similarity cache</link>
        from the top of the tree will generate the similarity data for all images.
      </note>
      <para>Similarity data are stored in a folder hierarchy that mirrors the location of the source images. The data have the same name as the original appended by the file extension .sim.</para>
      <para>
        The root of the hierarchy is:
        <para>
          <programlisting>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/geeqie/thumbnails/</programlisting>
          or, if $XDG_CACHE_HOME is not defined:
          <programlisting>$HOME/.cache/geeqie/thumbnails/</programlisting>
        </para>
      </para>
